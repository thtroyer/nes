# nes
Small repo for experimenting with NES (6502 assembly) (I have no idea what I'm doing yet)

## Assembler
Currently using the ca65 assembler to build projects.  There are build scripts showing how to assemble the projects in each directory.

## Projects so far
### Hello World
Minimalistic project to see how to draw sprites onto the screen, draw a background, handle some controller input, and move the sprites.  Mostly complete, but will update as I learn better best practices.

### Jump man
My attempts at learning how to do platformer physics so far.  This will be in progress for a while.
