# nes
Small repo for experimenting creating games for the Nintendo Entertainment System (6502 assembly).

## Assembler
Currently using the ca65 assembler to build projects.  There are build scripts showing how to assemble the projects in each directory.

## Projects so far
### Hello World
Minimalistic project to see how to draw sprites onto the screen, draw a background, handle some controller input, and move the sprites.  Mostly complete, but will update as I learn best practices.

### Simple Platformer
My attempts at learning how to do platformer physics so far.  This will be in progress for a while.
